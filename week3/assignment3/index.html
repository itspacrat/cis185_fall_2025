                This is my more organic portfolio, built with bootstrap.css! I've strewn a few content cards throughout
                this page and added some flavor, relative to my last portfolio example.

                I have helped release a<a href="">couple of games</a>in my time, and love designing game systems, from
                tabletop-style rpgs to 2D survival sandboxes.

                bridging the gap
                between messaging platforms and game systems, and always aim to write software that facilitates natural
                interaction.
