            This is my more organic portfolio, built manually to be responsive, with grid! I've strewn a few content
            cards throughout
            this page and added some flavor, relative to my last portfolio example.

            I have helped release a<a href="">couple of games</a>in my time, and love designing game systems, from
            tabletop-style rpgs to 2D survival sandboxes.

        <div class="infoBlock">
            I also have written a few discord bots, with my latest being <a
                href="https://github.com/itspacrat/giflias">giflias</a> on github. I love
            bridging the gap
            between messaging platforms and game systems, and always aim to write software that facilitates natural
            interaction.

            <p>I've been studying computer science and its adjacent fields since 2017, but have had a genreal
                compassion for working on computers since I was very little!</p>
            <p>Using the computer as a creative medium has given me a nearly endless hobby, and I am excited more
                every day to learn new interface or systems design concepts and experiment with them.</p>

        <div class="infoBlock">the bootstrap version of this portfolio is <a href="index.html">here</a>.</div>
        <div class="infoBlock">Bootstrap made the construction of this page nearly seamless, and was
            incredibly easy. I've used 2 blank columns to add a gap in this row with ease!</div>

                kinda dig it!</p>

        <div class="infoBlock" style="text-align:center;">I should probably fill this bottom section out
            with footer info or some sort of copyright notice. oh well.<br><i>Imitation is flattery, to whoever
